The main problem I encountered when working through the different problems in the course was properly implementing each data structure and learning when the best time is to use each data structure. What I found worked best when tackling larger problems is taking a step back and breaking problems down to smaller steps.  I believe my knowledge of learning how to manipulate data through different structures such as vectors, hash tables, Binary search trees etc. Writing bigger programs with more lines of code has taught me the importance of keeping your code clean and modulated so it is easily readable.
